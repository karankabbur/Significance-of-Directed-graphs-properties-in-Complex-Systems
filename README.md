Significance of Directed graphs properties in Complex Systems.
In many complex systems the interactions between elements are not necessarily symmetric, so they are best described by directed networks. Furthermore, directed network exhibit trophic coherence q
which is a structural property which measures how neatly the nodes fall into distinct levels. In fact,
complex network also displays properties such as “non normality” and “ All these proper-ties can be related, at least in expectation, to the ‘loop exponent’ which is a function only of trophic co-herence and the in- and out-degree sequences. This parameter can be obtained by using the basal-en-semble expectations which is a subset of graphs from the directed configuration ensemble that satisfy
the constraint. Moreover, using degree sequences from the original datasets, a directed configuration
ensemble of random graphs was generated and has been used to compare its properties with original
networks. Modelling of such complex networks which has its own trophic incoherence parameter q has
been also done using Generalized Preferential Prey model
On the other hand, trophic coherence and non-normality affect many other topological properties, such as whether there will exist a giant strongly connected component of vertices that are mutually reachable. Finally, the “loop exponent” correctly classifies various networks like genetic, metabolic,
trade, food webs, language, neural a nd social into two distinct regimes : loopful and loopless .





Project about the paper: Looplessness in networks is linked to trophic coherence by S Johnson 

The data used correspond to the one by Jhonsson. The main notebook where all the data can find is called:

"Looplessness - Original Dataset" where we implemented and compute topological properties of directed graphs such as looplessles regime, non normalization matriced, strong connectiviy graph and show the correlation among them and also with the trophic coherence parameter.

The notebook "Comparison Basal Ensemble" consist on the implementation of a directed configuration ensemble which is then compared with the analitical solutions find in the paper.

In the trophic level graph we plot several networks according to the trophic coherence parameter.

In Pref_preying_model the preferential preying model is applied and analized also in the remain notebooks.
